#  Share Your Lesson: Overview
Sharing your Lesson is a convenient way to share both:
  - A new lesson you've created. 
  - Any new activities you've created within an existing lesson. 
  
  You can share your lesson with anyone who has an ANVILL account by copying and providing a direct link to the lesson page, and/or e-mailing invitations to view the lesson. Read below to learn how.</big>
