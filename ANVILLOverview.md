# <BIG>ANVILL Overview</BIG> 

<BIG>What is ANVILL?
&nbsp;
 ANVILL is a web-based tool designed for language instructors anywhere who wish to strengthen students out of class opportunities to practice their language skills. This includes easy to create, assign, and assess interactive listening and speaking activities. ANVILL is a great fit for language courses with a blended, hybrid, flipped, or online approach.
  
  ANVILL also foregrounds key elements of modern language lesson planning and task design: input and output tasks are connected; multimedia elements are easily added, edited, and reused; learner output can be shared or private; and learner outcomes are presented in easily understood reports.
  
  Since 2007 ANVILL has been a free open educational resource (OER) for educators working in non-profit schools around the world. It is ad-free; we don't share your personal information or data.

# Can anyone use ANVILL?

ANVILL-LTI is a web-based service of the Yamada Language Center at the University of Oregon —there's nothing to download. Like its predecessor, ANVILL-LTI is free to qualified language educators—those working in not-for-profit educational institutions around the world.

# ANVILL & Learning Management Systems

ANVILL is LTI compatible. LTI stands for “learning tool interoperability.” This means you can run ANVILL inside of various learning management systems (LMSs) such as Moodle or Canvas. Requests for LTI integration with your LMS can be made inside your ANVILL account under Settings. ANVILL-LTI is built with Drupal, and its HTML 5-based audio/video tools and its lesson planning modules are available as open source software on Drupal.Org.

# Where's my data stored?

ANVILL data resides on servers and cloud services administered by the University of Oregon. ANVILL-LTI users must abide by the university's policies on acceptable IT use. 

ANVILL protects the privacy of its users, whether running inside an LMS such as Moodle or Canvas, or whether running as a standalone service.
