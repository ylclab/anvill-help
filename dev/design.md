# Discussion

## General

- Better way to handle multiple dialogs to prevent overlay black screen? Yes we should for as much as we can, but not VB.

## Voiceboards

- Is a reddit like VB view necessary?
- How often has it been requested?
- What issues would it be solving?
- How to deal with scrolling and limited size?
- Loading placeholder takes up too much room? Should no content be labeled?

## Lesson Tags

- Is folders and tagging a frequently requested feature? 
- How would it be used? For search? For sequencing? For grouping?

## Accessibilty

- Placeholder text is too low contrast.
- Favicon invisible on white backgrounds.

## Lessons

- If image header, header stays normal height.
- If no image header, header shrinks to title.

## Dashboard

- Remove owned and shared lesson distinction
- Possibly remove the icon?
- Move badge somewhere.

## Media

- Media player doesn't match theme
- Remove timeline bar during playback.
- Change audio & video blue to primary green.
- Use Martha's mockup for audio player everywhere.

## UI

- Folders/Drawer issues? We need to clarify what this is.
