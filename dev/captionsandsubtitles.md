# <big>Captions and Subtitles: Overview
The "Add Text Track" feature in ANVILL allows you to add captions and subtitles to a video. Captions are the transcription of spoken dialogue into that same language. Subtitles are translations of that dialogue.
  
  Please note YouTube videos are unsupported in ANVLL. However, YouTube videos have their own captions and subtitles available on their website.

Here are some examples by language:
  English: en
  Chinese: zh
  Cree: cr
  Spanish: es 
  Modern Greek: el
