  -	<span style="color: lightgreen;">Update: 
  added explanation to Course Prez, Interactive Video, & Column Help pages... add more?</span>
  
3.  Mobile app documentation (cont'd)
 	- Add documentation sections for app features where changing existing Help Page language isn't enough  (Ex. Interactive Video)

  	- <span style="color: lightgreen;">Update:

# To Add/Change in HD
- Screencasts: 
  	- Question: Based on existing screencasts, are there any other topics we should add right away?
- "Copy/paste" feature description (C. Prez, Interactive Vid, Column)
- App descriptions to pages where notes in extant instructions insufficient (ex. interactive vid)
- Interactive book page
- Eventually: alt-tags for ANVILL Help Wiki Images
- "Desktop app" = proper term
- "Mobile app" coming out "fall 2020" (not Sept 2020)
# Markdown Mysteries
  - Photo alignment: 
  I know how to align photo left/center/right. My trouble is then aliging & formatting text around it (my current methods don't produce great results). How to do it properly? 
  - Photo Caption:
  Once was taught, now can't do: figure out or ask if can't
  - Possible to delete multiple images I've uploaded at once?
  
# ?'s to Save for Later
- Possible to copy/paste Voicebaord? I could not seem to
- Future possibilities:
	- Accessibility options? (Create ANVILL Wiki Page on tools within ANVILL to make activity more accessible... for example, typing in "Hover Text" option in editor)
	- Using ANVILL in LMS? (Create ANVILL Wiki Help Pages for it eventually>)
- Referncing LMS as "learning platform" instead or in addition? 
	- Reason: more accessible & widely understandable reference term
