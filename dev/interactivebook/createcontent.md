# 1. Overview
You may want to combine multiple ANVILL content options in one place or activity in your lesson. Interactive Book and [Column](/en/column) Layout are the ideal tools with which to do so. You can always of course add individual content to the ANVILL lesson one by one, but Interactive Book and Column allow you to do so in one single organized container on an ANVILL lesson page.

# 2. Add Book to Lesson 
  1. [Open the ANVILL Lesson in which you want to add a Column](/en/createlesson). 
  - *Note:* Click on the above link if you need to learn how.
  2. Click or tap on "+ Add Content" at the top of your ANVILL Lesson screen. A menu will now open with a variety of content choices.
  1. Click or tap on the "Interactive Book" icon in the Add Content Menu. 
  1. An Interactive Book will now open on your ANVILL Lesson page.
