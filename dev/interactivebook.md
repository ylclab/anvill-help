  # 1. Overview 
You may want to combine multiple ANVILL content options in one place or activity in your lesson. Interactive Book and [Column](/en/column) Layout are the ideal tools with which to do so. You can always of course add individual content to the ANVILL lesson one by one, but Interactive Book and Column allow you to do so in one single organized container on an ANVILL lesson page.
