If you want ANVILL to work well in any situation, use:

:white_check_mark: **Google Chrome** 
  :white_check_mark: **Mozilla Firefox***
    :white_check_mark: **Microsoft Edge*** 
*(note: Firefox and Edge work well with everything *except* "Speak the Words" activities which use Speech Recognition software requiring Chrome)
  
  
Other browsers are incompatible with the rich variety of ANVILL activities. 

Thus, ANVILL does not currently support:
  
 :x:**Apple Safari**
