# Dictation: Overview
[Dictation](https://h5p.org/dictation) supports focused, intentional listening opportunities. Learners must actively and carefully listen to what is said.  You can  create Dictation activities to require targeted, attentive listening to particular features of spoken language. Sound samples can include single words, phrases, or brief speech samples.

While Dictation was originally designed for any kind of exercise where the student should transcribe something  spoken, you can easily design a variety of other listening-based exercises. 

Dictation tasks are flexible and also readily combined with other activities. 


<big>**Some dictation tool ideas to get you started:**</big>  
- Discriminate  minimal pair sounds (Ex. sheep/ship; cheep/chip)

- Respond to spoken interview or comprehension questions
- Identify how many words heard in a phrase, then compare how many words were actually said & observe why: (e.g any words/sounds that dissapear, blend, etc) 
- Phonetically represent what they hear (Ex. didja v. did you) to practice connected speech
- Listen for and identify word stress or intonation 
- Complete intentional "gaps" left in a recording with an appropriate/correct word or phrase
- Use verbal context clues & connectors to reconstruct a story or conversation added in Dictation out of order
- Flip dication into a production activity: learners make & send recordings to add to a Dictation activity

Notice there are Default instructions for this field: "Please listen carefully and write what you hear" . That description will automatically save if you don't change anything.
1. You are now ready to add sound files to your Dictation task. See detailed instructions below.

## 2.1 Record and Upload Sound Samples

1. To add a sound sample, first you must click on the gray box with the plus sign. You will see two boxes like this. Click on the top one. You can use the bottom one to add a secondary sample later if desired.
 	- Top **"Sound Sample" (required):** This is where you add your primary sound sample 
  	- Bottom **"Sound Sample Slow" (optional):** Add a slower version of your speech sample if wanted
1. After you click on the gray box with the plus sign, you will be prompted to upload or record your Sound Sample.
&nbsp;
	**To Upload:**	
  	- Click on "upload" 
    - Drag & drop or select the sound file you want to add from your phone or compute

	- Click on the blue "+ Add Sentence" button on the left to add another Dictation
	- To save your work and exit, click on the check mark icon above your Dictation activity. 



## 2.2 Additional Dictation Features Worth Knowing

With the dictation tool, you can also:

- Limit the numbers of times a student can listen to a sample
- Decide whether punctuation matters in responses
- Assign a point value to typos, and/or choose whether students can see the "solution" to the question

To access these features, open the "Behavioral Settings" drop-down bar in the Dictation Task's edit screen.</big>
