ANVILL's Text tool provides a straightforward way to author and post written content on a lesson. It allows you to include hyperlinks, bulleted lists, and Youtube or Vimeo videos.

The Text Tool is a great way to:

- Communicate simple, clear messages or instructions on the actual lesson page.
- Compile an easily accessible list of references to your page.
- Add lesson content such as short stories.
- Model a writing activity; add samples.
- Delineate lesson goals
