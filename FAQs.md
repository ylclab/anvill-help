   Firefox also works well, though if you use a an ANVILL activity that requires speech recognition (e.g. Dictation, "Speak the Words") you'll need Chrome. 
  
Microsoft Edge and Safari are NOT recommended and likely to cause unnecessary issues.

  <big><big>**Why won't my ANVILL activity work?**</big></big>
  
  There is more than one reason an ANVILL activity may not be working right, but the first thing to do if your activity isn't working correctly is to check what browser you are using.
