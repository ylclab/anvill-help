# 1. Overview 
Your instructor has posted a Voiceboard activity as part of your out-of-class work to better prepare you for what you’ll be asked to do in-class (and in real life): demonstrate your understanding of “authentic” language and respond to it accurately and appropriately. 
 
It's important you review and understand your Teacher's instructions on how to respond to their Voiceboard Post. There are many options in Voiceboard and you need to know which to use. You may be asked to respond to the instructor only, comment on classmate responses, and/or include video, audio, or a written message.
