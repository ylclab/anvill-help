# Overview 
The [Column](https://h5p.org/column) feature allows you to add and organize multiple content types vertically. 

You can combine multiple interactive features within a single column for a more dynamic learner experience. For example, you can: add a Voiceboard activity a student must verbally respond to, ollowed by an URL a student must review before completing a related Essay prompt and multiple choice question set in the same column. Your column can be centered within your ANVILL lesson or justified to the left or right. 

If you like the Column feature, another multifaceted interactive tool to check out is [Course Presentation](https://anvill-help.uoregon.edu/e/en/audiofiles), which  uses a landscape layout to display slideshows with media, and a variety of carefully sequenced interactivity. 

You can also blend one or more content or interaction type using: [Voiceboard](https://anvill-help.uoregon.edu/e/en/voiceboard) interactive speech based discussions, [Interactive Videos](https://anvill-help.uoregon.edu/e/en/interactivevideo),  and [Quiz (Question Set)](https://anvill-help.uoregon.edu/e/en/quiz) features.
