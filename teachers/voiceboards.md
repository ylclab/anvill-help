# 1. Voiceboard: Overview 
## 1.1 What is "Voiceboard"?
  Voiceboard activities support meaningful speaking practice beyond the classroom. Instructors can easily post audio and/or video messages plus add images, documents, and written comments too. Multimedia can be uploaded, embedded, or recorded in ANVILL. 
  
  Students  can respond with their own Voiceboard. Students also have the ability to add images, documents, or written comments though the instructor can choose which options are available to students.

# 5. Questions About Students & Voiceboard
## 5.1 Can students see each other's Voiceboard responses?

It depends! Voiceboard's Privacy Setting lets the instructor to decide. There are two options:
  - "**Public**": 
  Instructor & students can see (and comment on) all student responses. This is the default Privacy Setting.
  - "**Private"**: 
  Only the instructor and student can see and comment on that individual student's responses.
