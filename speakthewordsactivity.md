# Speak the Words: Overview
When you create Speak the Words activities, you create opportunities for students to practice pronouncing words or phrases. Speak the Words activities utilize Speech Recognition software to achieve this. You can create questions or prompts the student responds to verbally and receives immediate feedback on for its accuracy. 
  
  You can create a single "Speak the Words" question in a lesson, or a series of questions by adding a "Speak the Words Set" instead. 
  
  [Open this link to see an example of a Speak the Words Set](https://h5p.org/speak-the-words-set). The linked example takes you to the H5P website, where "Speak the Words" was created.
