# 1. Overview

The Column  tool allows you to gather & organize content in a vertical layout. It's the only tool that acts as a container in which to add multiple ANVILL activities and content. 
  
  This helpful resource therefore allows you to create thoughtfully designed, well-scaffolded activities and/or compile interrelated content in one place.

The above images show a Column and Voiceboard activity side-by-side. They are here to help you visualize how Column can organize diverse content in one vertical layout. 
  
  This particular column example includes: text, an audio file, a multiple choice question set (the dots below the answers indicate its a four part set), and a summary statement activity. The Voiceboard activity to the right then builds even further off the Column activity, both in topic and task complexity.
