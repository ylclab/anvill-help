# 1. Overview
There's more than one way to open an ANVILL Lesson. Access them using Lesson Links or from inside your ANVILL account. You can bookmark Lesson Links for easy access. 
  
 

# 2. Open a New Lesson 
1. Your instructor will provide you with a link to the lesson. They usually do this one of two ways:
  - Posting the link in a platform such as Canvas, Moodle, or Blackboard.
  - Email invitation. So you know what to look for in your inbox, see below example.
 

Email Invitation Example:

  2. Click on the Lesson Link. 
  3. Log in to ANVILL if prompted. If you're already logged in, the lesson will automatically open.
 
  *Note: If you cannot find a Lesson Link, ask a classmate or your instructor for help.*

# 3. Open an Existing Lesson
*Option 1:* [Use the Lesson Link your instructor provided](/en/students/openlesson#h-2-open-a-new-lesson) the first time you opened the lesson. You can bookmark Lesson Links for easy access.

  1. Log in to your account. [(Click here to open ANVILL's log in page)](https://anvill.uoregon.edu/).
