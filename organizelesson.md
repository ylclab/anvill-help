# <big>Organize Your Lesson: Overview</big>
<big>Rearranging lesson layout empowers you to maximize the flow of your content. You can make changes at any time. There are two main types of change: reordering the layout of overall lesson content, and changing the size of of individual content in your lesson.

# 1. Individual ANVILL Content Elements
 ## 1.1 Resize Content
![column_2.png](/column_2.png =x300){.align-right}Lesson content can have a wide landscape layout or shrink to half the size for a  column like appearance.

&nbsp;

As the image on the right shows, reduced size makes it possible to place two pieces of content side-by-side.
&nbsp;

<big>To Change Content Layout:</big>
