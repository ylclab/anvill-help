2. Click on the green cricle with the vertical ellipses in the bottom right corner of your ANVILL lesson's screen.</big>

5. Please notice you can look at "Lesson Outcomes" (i.e. the outcomes for the ANVILL lesson/page you are on) with an overview, by activity, or by user. For example:
   	- "Overview": illustrates overall statistics from the lesson
  	- "By activity": breaks statistics down into individual activities you've chosen to include in your lesson (ex. course presentation, interactive video, dictation, etc.)
 	 -  "By users": shows analytics based on individual learner/student
