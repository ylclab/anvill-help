# Overview
<a href="https://anvill.uoregon.edu/">ANVILL</a> is a web-based toolbox for language teachers that makes it easy to create, assign, and assess spoken language tasks. It is particularly useful for teachers looking to provide students with language practice outside of class, or in a lab setting. 

ANVILL foregrounds key elements of modern language lesson planning and task design: input and output tasks are connected; multimedia elements are easily added, edited, and reused; learner output can be shared or private; and learner outcomes are presented in easily understood reports.

<mark>ANVILL is a free open educational resource OER for any instructor working in a non-profit environment. **Jeff:** this is true as stated, correct?</mark> 

<mark>Also, personal opinion respectfully states: I feel that ANVILL & its possibilities are far beyond the "spoken language" task element, although I agree the ability to meaninfgully engage in speaking and listening outside of class are fundamental elements. I would like to address & clarify this overview & topic in our meeting. Please & thank you!</mark>
